Q3.1:
    These are the computed results.
    They can be reproduced by running test_dotProdKernel in test.py
-----------------------------------------------------------------
    average loss at 100 steps: 0.250000
    average loss at 200 steps: 0.185000
    average loss at 300 steps: 0.190000
    average loss at 400 steps: 0.172500
    average loss at 500 steps: 0.170000
    average loss at 600 steps: 0.153333
    average loss at 700 steps: 0.142857
    average loss at 800 steps: 0.142500
    average loss at 900 steps: 0.131111
    Training data loss: 0.055000
    Test data loss: 0.086000

Q3.2:
    d = 3 produces the lowest loss. The results showing
    this can be reproduced by running test_polyKernels in test.py

Q3.3:
    Results of running test_exponentialKernel in test.py:
